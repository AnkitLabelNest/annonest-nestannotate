Context:
We are on the Project Detail page (News project).
Project already exists and project_id is available in route params.
Backend is Supabase.
Tables involved:
- news
- annotation_tasks
- project_members (project_id, user_id, role) OR equivalent existing table
- users (id, name/email)

STRICT RULES:
- News can ONLY be uploaded inside a project
- Uploading news MUST automatically create annotation_tasks (via Supabase trigger)
- UI must NEVER write directly to annotation_tasks
- UI must only insert into news

WHAT TO BUILD ON THIS PAGE:

1) Upload News (CSV + manual)
- Clicking “Upload News” opens a modal
- Modal supports:
  a) CSV upload
  b) Manual single news entry
- Required fields to insert into `news`:
  - project_id (from page, hidden, mandatory)
  - org_id
  - headline
  - source_name
  - publish_date
  - url
  - raw_text (optional)
  - created_by (current user)

- On submit:
  - Insert rows ONLY into `news`
  - Do not insert into annotation_tasks
  - Assume Supabase trigger will auto-create annotation_tasks
  - Show success toast
  - Refresh task list

2) Team Assignment (Multi-select)
- Add a “Team” section in header (next to Upload News)
- Fetch project members using:
  SELECT users.id, users.name, users.email
  FROM project_members
  JOIN users ON users.id = project_members.user_id
  WHERE project_members.project_id = :project_id;

- Show multi-select dropdown:
  - Checkbox list
  - Allow selecting multiple users
  - Default: none selected

- When uploading news:
  - If 1 user selected → assign that user to annotation_tasks.assigned_to
  - If multiple users selected → create ONE annotation task per user
    (same news_id, same project_id, different assigned_to)
  - If none selected → assigned_to = project owner

3) Items List (Project Dashboard)
- This page must list annotation tasks, NOT news
- Query:
  SELECT
    at.id,
    at.status,
    at.assigned_to,
    at.created_at,
    n.headline,
    n.source_name,
    n.publish_date,
    n.url
  FROM annotation_tasks at
  JOIN news n ON n.id = (at.metadata->>'news_id')::uuid
  WHERE at.project_id = :project_id
  ORDER BY at.created_at DESC;

- Cards show:
  - Headline
  - Source
  - Date
  - Assigned user
  - Status (Pending / Completed)

4) Counts at top
- Total Items = count(annotation_tasks where project_id)
- Completed = status = 'completed'
- Pending = status != 'completed'

DO NOT:
- Add project_id to annotation_tasks manually
- Create new tables
- Change existing schema
- Show news without a task
- Allow upload outside project

Deliverables:
- Working Upload News modal
- CSV + manual entry
- Multi-user assignment
- Project dashboard auto-refreshes after upload
